# demo

Installation:



To check your node version please run the following command:

$ node -v
v5.8.0


Install all the project dependencies:

$ cd demo
$ npm install

You may get some deprecation warnings as well as peerDependency warnings in your terminal while/after the NPM installation. Please ignore those warnings.

Once you have installed the necessary NPM dependencies, start the node server by launching the "node app.js" command:

$ node app.js

Wait for the build/compilation to finish. Once that is complete you'll be notified in the terminal that your app is ready and is accessible via http://localhost:3000.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your app in action.
